# Worker Profiles App

A simple React Native application that allows users to browse and search through worker profiles based on different categories. The app displays workers' profile pictures, names, and flags representing their countries. It also includes a search functionality and category-based filtering.

## Features

- **Category-based Filtering**: Users can filter workers by their categories (e.g., by role or job type).
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar is available to allow users to search for workers by name.
- **Worker Profiles Display**: Workers' profiles are displayed in a grid, showing their picture, name, and country flag.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading indicator for 1-2 seconds when the app is launched for the first time.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile UI components.
- **Expo**: For quick and easy development, testing, and deployment of the app.
- **JSON Data**: Worker profiles and categories are loaded from JSON files.
- **React Hooks**: To manage the component state and handle side effects (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Icons**: Uses icons from `@expo/vector-icons` (specifically `AntDesign`).
